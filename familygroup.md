# Family Group - Spring Break 2021

- ## Lesson 1 (3/14) - Good Christians vs Bad Christians

   **Spoiler** - According to my father, Shug Baggott, there are only Christians who do good or bad things.

- ## Lesson 2 (3/15) - Do You Know Where You're Going?

   Do you have a plan for your future? This is a kickoff to get them ready to speak to tomorrow's lesson.

- ## Lesson 3 (3/16) - Do You Have a Plan?

   Sounds like a repeat but this is a tactile discussion of if they actually _have_ an actual plan, like written down, and if so, what is it and if not, why.

- ## Lesson 4 (3/17) - What Will Future You 5 Years From Now Say About Present You?

   This continues the theme of planning as a thought experiment of "so what would your plan succeeding look like".

- ## Lesson 5 (3/18) - What Will Family Man You Say About Present You?

   Again, a thought experiment to see if they can visualize themselves from their parent's eyes.

- ## Lesson 6 (3/19) - What Does a "personal relation with Christ" Mean?

   Discussion about what _I_ think is the #1 element of a successful plan. Also, I've heard members of the group say on more than one occasion, "what does that even mean", even though they've all been "churched" about it tons.

- ## Lesson 7 (3/20) - How Will You Handle Post-Graduation?

   Bringing the entire week's discussion back around to the practical and focusing on the looming months ahead of them.
