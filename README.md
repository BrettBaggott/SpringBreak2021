# Spring Break 2021

## ABOUT

This is my repository for preparing to chaperone several young men on a Spring break trip to Santa Rosa Beach, Florida. I have had the pleasure to teach and mentor these young men over the last 10 years by serving as a Life Group leader, Church Camp counselor, and Quest leader/host home through [Long Hollow](https://longhollow.com) and other areas. One stipulation I made when I accepted the responsibility of being the chaperone is that we will have Family Group just like we would at Chruch Camp. I've started an outline for our Family Group time here: https://github.com/BrettBaggott/SpringBreak2021/blob/master/familygroup.md
